# Migration FAQ

### What's happening?

In the first "season" of our DCPT token, we saw 74,000+ wallets activated. Next, we're launching a broader protocol and converting to an ERC-2O token.

You can read the migration announcement [here](https://decrypt.co/75352/decrypt-reader-token-what-comes-next).

### How do I stay up-to-date on changes and new developments?

We recommend you join our [Discord server](https://decrypt.co/discord-invite), watch for new documentation on this website ([docs.decrypt.co](https://docs.decrypt.co)) and read the ["Our Company"](https://decrypt.co/news/decrypt) section of the News site.

### I can't re-authenticate my device under OST wallet settings in the mobile app. Will I be able to participate in the claims process?

We will use token balances associated with verified Decrypt accounts for the migration claim process. If you have a balance and meet the eligibility criteria, you will not need an authenticated OST wallet device to particiate in the claim process.

First, make sure you've upgraded to at least v3 of the mobile application. v3 is a major upgrade as it moves the app away from the OST platform.

### What will happen to my DCPT tokens and my OST wallet in the Decrypt App after Season 1?

We have decided to forgo a new Season 2 and instead create a new ERC-20 token and new protocol.

In the next release of the Decrypt mobile app (v3.0,) we will remove the ability to create new OST wallets, as well as any wallet and token functionality from the reading experience. 

We will maintain a snapshot of users’ DCPT balances, and use those balances to offer a 1:1 claim of a new ERC-20 token.

If you created a legacy wallet in an earlier version of the app, we will leave functionality to access your OST wallet seed phrase while the [OST platform](https://platform.ost.com) is still available. 

**Please Note:** Decrypt cannot make any guarantees about the availability of the OST platform. We encourage users to safely store their OST wallet seed phrase in case the platform becomes unavailable in the future. 

### Will I be able to earn DCPT or ERC-20 tokens in the app after Season 1?

The final distribution of the initial 21 million DCPT tokens will mark the end of Season 1. After Season 1, Decrypt users will not be able to earn DCPT or ERC-20 tokens in the app. We have decided to forgo a new Season 2 and instead create a new ERC-20 token and protocol that can interoperate with any website or application compatible with Ethereum wallets.

You will still be able to track your read progress, share, and react to articles in the app, and we have additional exciting features planned. In a future version of the app, we would like to add a “Decrypt Points” reader rewards experience that complements the ERC-20 token and protocol.

### How will the claim process work?

Qualifying Decrypt users with a sufficient DCPT balance at the end of Season 1 will be invited to link an Ethereum wallet to their Decrypt account, and we plan to offer a 1:1 claim of the new ERC-20 token based on users’ DCPT balance via a merkle root distribution contract—similar to [Uniswap’s UNI distribution contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor).

Our current plan is to:

1. Extend Decrypt account functionality to the website platform so readers will be able to log in and access their accounts on both the mobile app and the Decrypt.co website. 
2. Launch a dApp on decrypt.co that allows registered users to link an Ethereum wallet to their account. 
3. Give qualifying users with DCPT balances until a specified deadline to link an Ethereum wallet address to their account.
4. Use the balance records and the linked Ethereum addresses to create a merkle root distribution contract uniswap to offer a one-time claim of the new ERC-20 token.
5. Once the distribution contract is deployed, users will need to follow the instructions and will be responsible for any transaction fees. We may offer a bonus multiplier or other incentives to encourage users to claim their new ERC-20 tokens.

We are working on all the above steps and will provide detailed instructions closer to the distribution date.

### What can I do with the new ERC-20 tokens?

As a first step, we will extend [voting functionality](https://vote.decrypt.co/) on Decrypt community proposals for the ERC-20 token. We are also working to create unique community functionality and product features for readers that hold the token.

Long term, the primary motivation for this migration is to take advantage of the broader Ethereum ecosystem and build a protocol together with the community that becomes the platform for an industry-leading, community-governed web3 publication. Holders of this token will have the opportunity to help shape and create this future.

### What is happening to Decrypt Rewards?

This migration effort is our top priority, and we want to focus on it 100%. As such, we are pausing new rewards drops, at least until we’re ready to share more details about the initial protocol work.

We do plan to continue to offer future NFT and other on-chain rewards for both Decrypt readers and holders of the ERC-20 token. Having an ERC-20 token makes it easier to offer on-chain rewards via smart contracts, where we can take advantage of a simpler claims process and more developed tools.
